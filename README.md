# JPS for Weighted Grids

Created for Machine Learning Q2 project.

Based on original Jump Point Search algorithm proposed in "Online Graph Pruning for Pathfinding On Grid Maps", except modified to work on weighted grids (as opposed to unweighted grids). Runs on a series of benchmark tests which can be found and downloaded from [here](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/weighted/index.html).
